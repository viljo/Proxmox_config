# Service Deployment Checklist

**Service Name**: _______________
**Container ID**: _______________
**Started**: _______________
**Completed**: _______________

---

## Step 1: Implement Service ✅ Initial Deployment

**Objective**: Create working Ansible automation

- [ ] Ansible role created (`roles/<service>_api/`)
- [ ] Deployment playbook created (`playbooks/<service>-deploy.yml`)
- [ ] Uses Proxmox API (not pct exec)
- [ ] SSH delegation for config
- [ ] Health checks added
- [ ] Role README.md created
- [ ] Vault variables documented
- [ ] Initial deployment successful

**Deployment Time**: _____ minutes

---

## Step 2: Test with External Tools ✅ External Validation

**Objective**: Verify external accessibility

- [ ] HTTPS access works: `curl -I https://<service>.viljo.se`
- [ ] External testing service passed (HTTPie/Uptime Robot)
- [ ] Mobile data test passed (not admin network!)
- [ ] SSL certificate valid
- [ ] DNS resolves: `dig +short <service>.viljo.se @1.1.1.1`

**External Test Results**:
```
HTTPS Status: _____
External Service: _____
Mobile Test: _____
SSL Valid: _____
DNS: _____
```

---

## Step 3: Delete and Recreate ✅ Automation Validation

**Objective**: Prove automation works

```bash
# Delete
pct stop <id> && pct destroy <id>

# Recreate
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/<service>-deploy.yml
```

- [ ] Container deleted successfully
- [ ] Playbook recreated service without errors
- [ ] Service fully functional after recreation
- [ ] Second run is idempotent (changed=0 or 1)
- [ ] External access still works

**Deployment Time (2nd run)**: _____ minutes
**Idempotency**: changed=_____

---

## Step 4: Implement Data Backup Plan ✅ Backup Integration

**Objective**: Integrate data backups

**Backup Type**: [ ] Database [ ] Files [ ] Key-Value [ ] Other: _____

- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] Updated `backup_infrastructure` role defaults
- [ ] Updated `backup_infrastructure` role tasks
- [ ] Updated `restore_infrastructure` role defaults
- [ ] Updated `restore_infrastructure` role tasks
- [ ] Backup toggle works (enabled/disabled)

**Backup Files Location**:
```
/var/backups/infrastructure/<timestamp>/<type>/<service>_<timestamp>.<ext>
```

---

## Step 5: Populate with Test Data ✅ Data Creation

**Objective**: Add test data

- [ ] Test data script created: `scripts/populate-<service>-testdata.sh`
- [ ] At least 3 types of test data
- [ ] Data includes relationships/dependencies
- [ ] Data is verifiable (can count)
- [ ] Test data size > 1MB

**Test Data Summary**:
```
Type 1: _____ (count: _____)
Type 2: _____ (count: _____)
Type 3: _____ (count: _____)
Total Size: _____ MB
```

---

## Step 6: Test Backup Script ✅ Backup Verification

**Objective**: Verify backup works

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/backup-infrastructure.yml
```

- [ ] Backup script ran without errors
- [ ] Service data captured in backup
- [ ] Backup files have size > 0 bytes
- [ ] Backup files are valid (not corrupted)
- [ ] Backup includes all test data

**Backup Results**:
```
Backup Timestamp: _____
Backup Size: _____ MB
Backup Time: _____ minutes
Files Created: _____
```

---

## Step 7: Execute Backup ✅ Baseline Creation

**Objective**: Create baseline backup

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/backup-infrastructure.yml
TIMESTAMP=$(ls -1 /var/backups/infrastructure/ | tail -1)
echo $TIMESTAMP > /tmp/<service>-backup-timestamp.txt
```

- [ ] Baseline backup created
- [ ] Backup timestamp recorded
- [ ] Backup report created
- [ ] Service still running after backup

**Baseline Backup**:
```
Timestamp: _____
Size: _____ MB
Location: /var/backups/infrastructure/_____
```

---

## Step 8: Wipe Service ✅ Destructive Test

**Objective**: Completely remove service

**⚠️ WARNING**: Destructive operation!

```bash
# Verify backup exists first!
TIMESTAMP=$(cat /tmp/<service>-backup-timestamp.txt)
ls -lh /var/backups/infrastructure/$TIMESTAMP/ | grep <service>

# Wipe
pct stop <id>
pct destroy <id>
```

- [ ] Backup verified before wipe
- [ ] Container deleted
- [ ] Service inaccessible: `curl -I https://<service>.viljo.se` fails
- [ ] Data removed (if complete wipe)
- [ ] Backup still exists

**Wipe Type**: [ ] Container Only [ ] Container + Data

---

## Step 9: Restore and Verify ✅ DR Validation

**Objective**: Prove restoration works

```bash
# Restore container
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/<service>-deploy.yml

# Restore data
TIMESTAMP=$(cat /tmp/<service>-backup-timestamp.txt)
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/restore-infrastructure.yml \
  -e restore_backup_timestamp=$TIMESTAMP
```

- [ ] Container restored successfully
- [ ] Data restored successfully
- [ ] Service accessible: `curl -I https://<service>.viljo.se`
- [ ] Test data matches original
- [ ] External test passes (repeat Step 2)
- [ ] Completion report created

**Recovery Metrics**:
```
RTO (Recovery Time): _____ minutes
RPO (Data Loss): _____ minutes
Data Verification: [ ] Pass [ ] Fail
```

---

## Final Verification

- [ ] ✅ All 9 steps completed successfully
- [ ] ✅ Service declared PRODUCTION READY
- [ ] Documentation updated (README.md, container-mapping.md)
- [ ] Service added to full-deployment.yml
- [ ] Backup schedule confirmed
- [ ] Monitoring added (if applicable)

---
