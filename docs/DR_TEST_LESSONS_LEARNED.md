# Disaster Recovery Test - Lessons Learned
**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Test Type**: Full wipe and restore

## Summary

This document captures the key lessons learned from the first full disaster recovery test of the Proxmox infrastructure. The test successfully validated backup/restore procedures but identified critical gaps in automation maturity.

## What We Learned

### 1. Container Backups Work Well ✅

**Finding**: Proxmox vzdump successfully backed up and restored 9 out of 10 containers in ~10 minutes.

**Evidence**:
- Backup time: 2 minutes 45 seconds for 10 containers
- Restore time: ~10 minutes for 9 containers
- Success rate: 90%

**Action**: Continue using vzdump for container-level backups.

### 2. GitLab Backup Corruption is Critical ❌

**Finding**: All 3 GitLab backup attempts failed with checksum errors during restoration.

**Evidence**:
```
/*stdin*\ : Decoding error (36) : Restored data doesn't match checksum
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
```

**Root Causes** (suspected):
1. GitLab actively writing to disk during backup
2. 3.5GB size hitting zstd compression limits
3. Hardware I/O issues during backup
4. No post-backup verification

**Actions Taken**:
- None yet (pending infrastructure access)

**Actions Required**:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Manually backup GitLab using alternative method
   - Try stopping GitLab during backup
   - Try different compression (gzip instead of zstd)
   - Consider GitLab's built-in backup tools

2. **SHORT-TERM**: Implement post-backup verification
   ```bash
   # After each backup
   pct restore 999 <backup> --storage local-lvm  # Test restore to temp container
   pct destroy 999  # Clean up test
   ```

3. **LONG-TERM**:
   - Investigate Proxmox PBS (Proxmox Backup Server) for deduplicated backups
   - Set up off-site GitLab backup redundancy
   - Schedule GitLab backups during maintenance windows

### 3. Network Dependencies Break Automation ❌

**Finding**: DMZ services require firewall for internet access, but deployment automation doesn't account for this.

**Evidence**:
```
PostgreSQL container created successfully
apt update failed: "Failed to update cache after 5 retries"
Root cause: No firewall = no NAT = no internet
```

**Why It Matters**:
All DMZ containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, Keycloak, GitLab, Nextcloud, Mattermost) need the firewall running first to install packages from the internet.

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Updated `full-deployment.yml` to check firewall is running before deployment
2. ✅ Added clear prerequisite warning in deployment banner

**Actions Required**:
1. Create proper firewall restoration documentation
2. Consider creating quick-restore script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # restore-firewall.sh
   BACKUP=$(pvesm list local | grep "vzdump-lxc-101" | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
   pct restore 101 $BACKUP --storage local-lvm
   pct start 101
   sleep 10
   echo "Firewall restored and running"
   ```

3. Update DR runbook with explicit firewall-first step

### 4. Data-Level Backups Were Not Tested ⚠️

**Finding**: The DR test only validated container-level backups, not data-level backups (PostgreSQL databases, Redis data, Docker volumes).

**Why It Matters**:
Container backups include everything but:
- Are larger (more storage)
- Can't be restored incrementally
- Don't support point-in-time recovery
- May have consistency issues if services are running

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Re-enabled PostgreSQL database backups in `backup_infrastructure` role
2. ✅ Re-enabled Redis backups
3. ✅ Re-enabled Docker volume backups
4. ✅ Re-added Mattermost to backup lists

**Actions Required**:
1. Test PostgreSQL database restoration
2. Test Redis data restoration
3. Test Docker volume restoration
4. Test `restore-infrastructure.yml` playbook end-to-end

### 5. Vault Configuration Was Incomplete ⚠️

**Finding**: Deployment automation failed due to missing vault variables.

**Evidence**:
```
'vault_postgresql_root_password' is undefined
'vault_proxmox_api_token_id' is undefined
```

**Why It Happened**:
Automation roles were created but vault variables were never properly configured.

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Created temporary `dr_test_vars.yml` for testing (unencrypted)
2. ✅ Documented all required variables in `docs/VAULT_VARIABLES.md`
3. ✅ Added `.gitignore` protection for temporary files

**Actions Required**:
1. Properly encrypt all passwords in vault
2. Delete `dr_test_vars.yml` after testing
3. Test deployment with properly encrypted vault
4. Add vault validation to CI/CD

### 6. Deployment Automation Never Fully Tested ⚠️

**Finding**: Full deployment automation (`full-deployment.yml`) has never completed successfully end-to-end.

**Why It Matters**:
The deployment playbook claims to deploy all 11 services in 30-45 minutes, but this has never been validated.

**Blockers**:
1. Missing/incomplete vault variables
2. Network dependency on firewall
3. No integration testing environment
4. No rollback procedures

**Actions Required**:
1. Set up dedicated test environment
2. Complete vault configuration
3. Test full deployment end-to-end
4. Measure actual RTO (currently estimated)
5. Document known issues and workarounds

### 7. Backup Storage Strategy Needs Review ⚠️

**Finding**: Backups consume significant storage (e.g., GitLab: 3.5GB per backup × 3 attempts/day = 10.5GB/day).

**Current Storage**:
- Backups stored on same host as production
- No off-site backup
- No backup verification
- No retention policy enforcement

**Risks**:
1. Host failure = backup failure (single point of failure)
2. Ransomware could encrypt backups
3. Storage exhaustion possible
4. No disaster recovery if entire site lost

**Actions Required**:
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Set up off-site backup synchronization
2. Implement backup verification workflow
3. Enforce retention policies (currently configured but not enforced)
4. Consider Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) for deduplication
5. Document storage requirements in capacity planning

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Backup time | < 5 min | 2:45 | ✅ | Excellent |
| Restore time | < 30 min | 10 min | ✅ | Excellent |
| Container recovery | 100% | 90% | ⚠️ | GitLab failed |
| Data recovery | 100% | 0% | ❌ | Not tested |
| Full automation | Yes | No | ❌ | Blocked |
| RTO | < 1 hour | Unknown | ⚠️ | Needs testing |

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Re-enable data backups (PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker volumes)
2. ✅ Document required vault variables
3. ✅ Fix deployment playbook firewall prerequisite
4. ⏳ Investigate GitLab backup corruption
5. ⏳ Test `restore-infrastructure.yml` playbook

### Short-term (This Month)
1. Implement post-backup verification
2. Set up off-site backup synchronization
3. Complete vault configuration with proper encryption
4. Test full deployment automation end-to-end
5. Create firewall quick-restore script
6. Document GitLab backup workaround

### Long-term (Next Quarter)
1. Evaluate Proxmox Backup Server (PBS)
2. Implement automated DR testing (monthly)
3. Set up monitoring for backup success/failures
4. Create comprehensive DR runbook
5. Train team on DR procedures
6. Establish RTO/RPO SLAs

## Conclusion

The DR test successfully validated that container-level backups work reliably with a fast RTO. However, it exposed critical gaps in:

1. **Backup reliability**: GitLab backups 100% corrupted
2. **Automation maturity**: Deployment never fully tested
3. **Data-level backups**: Not tested in DR scenario
4. **Configuration management**: Vault incomplete

**Overall Assessment**: Infrastructure is 70% ready for disaster recovery. Critical issues must be addressed before considering it production-ready.

**Grade**: C+ (Partial Success)
- ✅ Proof of concept works
- ⚠️ Significant gaps identified
- ❌ Not production-ready
- ✅ Clear path to improvement

**Next DR Test**: 30 days (2025-11-23)
**Goal**: Address all HIGH priority items and validate fixes
