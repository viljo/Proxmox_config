# Specification Quality Checklist: Google OAuth Integration with Keycloak

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (Google OAuth authentication) and WHY (eliminate password management, improve security)
- Written in plain language describing user journeys and business outcomes
- No framework names (Ansible, PostgreSQL, etc.) appear in requirements - only in infrastructure context
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements have concrete values
- Each requirement is testable (e.g., FR-003: "automatically create user accounts" can be verified by checking account creation)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: "under 10 seconds", SC-003: "within 5 minutes", SC-006: "99.5% uptime")
- Success criteria avoid implementation (no mention of "Keycloak API response time" but instead "Users can authenticate in under 10 seconds")
- All 5 user stories include Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases cover failure scenarios (Google down, LDAP sync failure, account conflicts, Keycloak unavailable)
- Scope clearly bounded through 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P5)
- Assumptions section documents 10 explicit dependencies (Google SLA, Keycloak version, network connectivity, etc.)

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- 18 functional requirements all map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios cover: new user auth (P1), LDAP migration (P2), LDAP sync (P3), service integration (P4), custom app protection (P5)
- 10 success criteria are measurable and testable without knowing implementation
- Infrastructure requirements (IR-xxx) and Security requirements (SR-xxx) kept separate from user-facing functional requirements
- No technology-specific success criteria (e.g., not "Keycloak response time <200ms" but "authenticate in under 10 seconds")

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if additional clarification is needed before planning).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear user story prioritization enables MVP delivery (P1 alone is viable)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage anticipates failure modes
- Security requirements properly separated and aligned with project constitution
- Success criteria provide concrete acceptance tests without coupling to implementation
- Assumptions document clearly what must be true for feature to succeed

**No issues found** - specification meets all quality criteria.
