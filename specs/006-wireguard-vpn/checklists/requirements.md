# Specification Quality Checklist: WireGuard VPN Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Ready for Planning

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Clarifications Resolved (1/1)
1. **IR-002**: Network segment placement → Management network (vmbr0) for routing to 192.168.0.0/16 only (NOT DMZ)

### Quality Assessment
- **User Stories**: 3 prioritized stories (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
- **Functional Requirements**: 10 testable requirements covering VPN functionality
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: 7 requirements specifying LXC deployment on management network
- **Security Requirements**: 7 requirements covering cryptographic auth, encryption, auditing
- **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable outcomes (connection time, uptime, throughput, latency)
- **Edge Cases**: 8 identified scenarios for error handling
- **Scope Boundaries**: Clear assumptions, dependencies, and out-of-scope items

## Recommendation

✅ **PROCEED TO `/speckit.plan`** - Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning

All validation criteria passed. No blocking issues identified.
