- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Clarifications Resolved (3/3)
1. **IR-001**: Deployment type → LXC container (unprivileged)
2. **IR-002**: Network placement → DMZ network (vmbr3) at 172.16.10.0/24
3. **SR-007**: Network access policy → Full internet access

### Quality Assessment
- **User Stories**: 4 prioritized stories (P1-P4) with independent test criteria

- **Infrastructure Requirements**: 7 requirements specifying LXC deployment on DMZ
- **Security Requirements**: 7 requirements covering auth, HTTPS, privileges, network access
- **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable outcomes (latency, uptime, performance targets)
- **Edge Cases**: 8 identified scenarios for error handling
- **Scope Boundaries**: Clear assumptions, dependencies, and out-of-scope items

## Recommendation

✅ **PROCEED TO `/speckit.plan`** - Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning

All validation criteria passed. No blocking issues identified.
