# Feature Specification: GitLab CI/CD Platform

**Feature Branch**: `007-gitlab-ci-runner`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "gitlab and gitlab runner"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - GitLab Instance Deployment (Priority: P1)

As an infrastructure administrator, I need a self-hosted GitLab instance deployed in the Proxmox environment so that development teams can store source code, manage projects, and collaborate without relying on external services.

**Why this priority**: GitLab is the foundational component required for all other CI/CD functionality. Without the GitLab instance, runners cannot be registered or used.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the GitLab web interface, creating a test project, and pushing code to a repository. Delivers immediate value as a source code management platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** GitLab is deployed, **When** an administrator navigates to the GitLab URL, **Then** the GitLab login page is displayed with HTTPS enabled
2. **Given** GitLab is running, **When** an administrator logs in with initial credentials, **Then** they can access the admin dashboard
3. **Given** a user account exists, **When** the user creates a new project, **Then** the project is created and accessible via web interface
4. **Given** a project exists, **When** a user pushes code via Git, **Then** the code is stored and visible in the repository browser

---

### User Story 2 - GitLab Runner Registration (Priority: P2)

As a development team, I need GitLab Runners registered with the GitLab instance so that CI/CD pipelines can execute automatically when code is pushed to repositories.

**Why this priority**: Runners enable the core CI/CD functionality but depend on the GitLab instance being operational first. This is the next critical component after the main GitLab deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by registering a runner with GitLab, creating a simple `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in a test project, and observing successful pipeline execution. Delivers immediate CI/CD capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** GitLab is operational, **When** a GitLab Runner is installed and registered, **Then** the runner appears in the GitLab admin runners list as active
2. **Given** a runner is registered, **When** a project with a valid `.gitlab-ci.yml` file receives a commit, **Then** the runner picks up and executes the pipeline job
3. **Given** a pipeline job is running, **When** the administrator views the job logs, **Then** real-time execution output is visible
4. **Given** a pipeline job completes, **When** viewing the pipeline status, **Then** the job status (passed/failed) is correctly reported

---

### User Story 3 - GitLab.com Remote Runner Support (Priority: P2)

As a development team using GitLab.com, I need to register self-hosted runners in the Proxmox infrastructure so that CI/CD pipelines for projects hosted on GitLab.com can execute jobs locally while maintaining data sovereignty and reducing costs.

**Why this priority**: This enables hybrid workflows where teams can use GitLab.com for collaboration but execute sensitive or resource-intensive CI/CD jobs on private infrastructure, providing flexibility and control.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by registering a runner with a GitLab.com project, pushing code with a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to GitLab.com, and verifying the job executes on the self-hosted runner. Delivers immediate hybrid cloud capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitLab Runner is installed locally, **When** an administrator registers it with a GitLab.com project using a registration token, **Then** the runner appears as active in the GitLab.com project's CI/CD settings
2. **Given** a runner is registered with GitLab.com, **When** code is pushed to a GitLab.com repository with a pipeline configuration, **Then** the self-hosted runner picks up and executes the pipeline job
3. **Given** a pipeline job is running on a self-hosted runner, **When** viewing job logs on GitLab.com, **Then** real-time execution output from the self-hosted runner is visible
4. **Given** network connectivity is lost between the runner and GitLab.com, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** the runner reconnects and continues processing queued jobs

### User Story 4 - Authentication Integration (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I need GitLab to authenticate users via the existing Keycloak OIDC infrastructure so that users can access GitLab with their centralized credentials without managing separate accounts.

**Why this priority**: While important for user experience and security, GitLab can function with local accounts initially. This integration can be added after core functionality is verified.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring OIDC settings in GitLab, attempting to log in via Keycloak SSO, and verifying that user accounts are automatically created. Delivers improved user experience and security posture.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Keycloak OIDC is configured in GitLab, **When** a user clicks "Sign in with OIDC", **Then** they are redirected to the Keycloak login page
2. **Given** a user authenticates via Keycloak, **When** authentication succeeds, **Then** the user is redirected back to GitLab and logged in
3. **Given** a new user logs in via OIDC, **When** authentication completes, **Then** a GitLab user account is automatically created with appropriate permissions
4. **Given** a user logs out of GitLab, **When** they attempt to access protected resources, **Then** they are prompted to authenticate again

---

### User Story 5 - Container Registry Deployment (Priority: P4)

As a development team, I need an integrated container registry so that CI/CD pipelines can build, store, and deploy Docker images without relying on external registries.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for containerized workflows, this is an enhancement that can be added after basic CI/CD functionality is operational.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling the container registry in GitLab, building a Docker image in a pipeline job, and pushing it to the registry. Delivers container image management capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the container registry is enabled, **When** a pipeline builds a Docker image and pushes to the registry, **Then** the image is stored and visible in the project's container registry
2. **Given** an image exists in the registry, **When** a deployment job pulls the image, **Then** the image is successfully retrieved and can be deployed
3. **Given** the registry requires authentication, **When** a user attempts to pull an image, **Then** they must provide valid credentials
4. **Given** storage space is limited, **When** old images exceed retention policy, **Then** they are automatically cleaned up

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitLab storage reaches capacity and prevents new repository commits?
- How does the system handle GitLab Runner failures during pipeline execution?
- What occurs when the PostgreSQL database becomes unavailable or experiences connection timeouts?
- How are runner resources managed when multiple concurrent pipelines exceed available capacity?
- What happens when authentication services (Keycloak/LDAP) are unreachable during login attempts?
- How does GitLab handle SSL certificate expiration for HTTPS access via Traefik?
- What occurs when backup operations interfere with active pipeline executions?
- How does the runner handle network interruptions when communicating with GitLab.com?
- What happens when a self-hosted runner exceeds the job timeout configured in GitLab.com?
