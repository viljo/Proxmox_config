# Specification Quality Checklist: GitLab CI/CD Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality
✅ **PASS** - Specification contains no implementation details (Docker, PostgreSQL mentioned only as service names, not implementation requirements). Focus is on capabilities and user value.

✅ **PASS** - All user stories clearly articulate user value ("so that development teams can...", "while maintaining data sovereignty and reducing costs").

✅ **PASS** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders with clear explanations of what the system does rather than how it works.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (Functional, Infrastructure, Security), Key Entities, Success Criteria.

### Requirement Completeness
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the specification.

✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable:
  - FR-004: "System MUST support registering runners with both self-hosted GitLab instances and GitLab.com projects" - testable by attempting registration
  - FR-017: "automatically reconnect after network interruptions" - testable by simulating network failure
  - All other requirements similarly testable

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include specific, measurable metrics:
  - SC-001: "within 2 minutes"
  - SC-002: "within 5 minutes"
  - SC-003: "at least 3 concurrent pipeline jobs"
  - SC-012: "within 60 seconds"

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on user-facing outcomes:
  - "GitLab instance is accessible" (not "nginx responds")
  - "Users can create a project" (not "API call succeeds")
  - "Git operations complete successfully" (not "git binary executes")

✅ **PASS** - Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases section includes 9 relevant scenarios covering storage, failures, authentication, network, and operational concerns.

✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly defined through 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) with explicit priority explanations. Core functionality (GitLab instance + runners) is P1-P2, enhancements are P3-P4.

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies identified in requirements:
  - Keycloak OIDC/LDAP (SR-001, FR-015)
  - Traefik reverse proxy (SR-004, IR-008)
  - NetBox integration (IR-003)
  - Zabbix/Prometheus monitoring (IR-004)
  - Proxmox Backup Server (IR-005)

### Feature Readiness
✅ **PASS** - All 17 functional requirements can be verified through user scenarios and acceptance criteria.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover:
  - Self-hosted GitLab deployment (P1)
  - Local runner registration and execution (P2)
  - GitLab.com remote runner support (P2)
  - Authentication integration (P3)
  - Container registry (P4)

✅ **PASS** - All 12 success criteria are measurable and aligned with functional requirements and user stories.

✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains focus on "what" not "how" throughout all sections.

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to the `/speckit.plan` phase. All validation criteria have been met:

- Clear user value proposition for each feature priority level
- Comprehensive coverage of both self-hosted and GitLab.com runner scenarios
- Measurable success criteria with specific time and performance targets
- No implementation decisions premature for the specification phase
- Well-defined scope with P1-P4 prioritization enabling incremental delivery

**Key Strengths**:
1. GitLab.com remote runner support (User Story 3) provides valuable hybrid cloud capability
2. Success criteria SC-011 and SC-012 specifically validate the GitLab.com integration
3. Security requirements comprehensively address both self-hosted and cloud scenarios
4. Edge cases cover network resilience concerns critical for GitLab.com connectivity
