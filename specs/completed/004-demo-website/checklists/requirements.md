# Specification Quality Checklist: Demo Website

**Feature**: Demo Website
**Branch**: 004-demo-website
**Spec File**: `specs/004-demo-website/spec.md`
**Date**: 2025-10-20

---

## Content Quality

- [x] **No Implementation Details**: Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
  - ✓ No Ansible role names, file paths, or code snippets in requirements
  - ✓ Requirements describe outcomes, not technical implementation

- [x] **User-Centric Language**: Written from user/stakeholder perspective
  - ✓ User stories describe user needs and value
  - ✓ Requirements state system behavior, not technical tasks

- [x] **Technology-Agnostic Success Criteria**: Measurable without implementation knowledge
  - ✓ SC-001: "Users can access via HTTPS" (not "nginx serves HTTPS")
  - ✓ SC-002: "Page load under 2 seconds" (not "nginx response time")
  - ✓ SC-005: "Deployment under 5 minutes" (not "Ansible execution time")

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] **All Requirements Testable**: Each requirement can be independently verified
  - ✓ FR-001 to FR-008: Specific, measurable deployment and configuration outcomes
  - ✓ IR-001 to IR-006: Verifiable infrastructure constraints
  - ✓ SR-001 to SR-005: Security controls with clear acceptance criteria

- [x] **All Requirements Measurable**: Clear pass/fail criteria exist
  - ✓ Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-007) provide quantifiable metrics
  - ✓ User story acceptance scenarios have Given/When/Then structure

- [x] **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers**: All sections are fully specified
  - ✓ Zero placeholder markers in spec.md
  - ✓ All sections have concrete, actionable content

- [x] **Appropriate Detail Level**: Sufficient for planning without over-specification
  - ✓ Key entities section defines infrastructure components
  - ✓ Requirements constrain solution without dictating implementation

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] **User Stories Prioritized**: Clear P1, P2, P3 priorities with rationale
  - ✓ P1: Public HTTPS Demo Site (core value)
  - ✓ P2: Container Deployment and Management (required infrastructure)
  - ✓ P3: Traefik Integration and Routing (production-grade enhancement)

- [x] **Independent User Stories**: Each story can be implemented and tested separately
  - ✓ US1 testable by navigating to demo domain with HTTPS
  - ✓ US2 testable by verifying container exists and nginx is active
  - ✓ US3 testable by verifying Traefik routes and certificate provisioning

- [x] **Acceptance Criteria Complete**: Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios
  - ✓ US1: 3 acceptance scenarios covering HTTPS access, redirects, content
  - ✓ US2: 3 acceptance scenarios covering deployment, auto-start, nginx status
  - ✓ US3: 3 acceptance scenarios covering routing, certificates, renewal

- [x] **Success Criteria Cover All Stories**: Measurable outcomes align with user stories
  - ✓ SC-001, SC-002, SC-007: Cover US1 (HTTPS access and performance)
  - ✓ SC-003, SC-005: Cover US2 (container deployment and automation)
  - ✓ SC-006: Cover US3 (certificate automation)

- [x] **Edge Cases Identified**: Potential failure scenarios documented
  - ✓ 6 edge cases documented (nginx crashes, resource exhaustion, etc.)
  - ✓ Prompts consideration of error handling and resilience

- [x] **Assumptions Documented**: External dependencies and preconditions clear
  - ✓ 8 assumptions covering Traefik, DNS, networks, templates
  - ✓ Clear context for implementation team

- [x] **Dependencies Listed**: Required infrastructure and services identified
  - ✓ 7 dependencies including Proxmox, networks, Traefik, Ansible
  - ✓ Enables proper sequencing and prerequisite verification

- [x] **Out of Scope Defined**: Clear boundaries prevent scope creep
  - ✓ 8 out-of-scope items (dynamic content, databases, auth, CMS, etc.)
  - ✓ Focuses implementation on static demo site purpose

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive user story coverage with clear priorities
- All requirements are testable and measurable
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and quantifiable
- No clarification markers - specification is complete
- Excellent balance of detail (enough for planning, not over-specified)
- Strong alignment between existing `demo_site` role and documented requirements

**Recommendations**:
- Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` - specification is well-defined with zero ambiguities
- Alternative: Run `/speckit.clarify` to explore edge cases or add optional enhancements
- Implementation can begin immediately after planning phase

**Validation Result**: **PASS** - All quality criteria met

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Specification created and validated
2. **Choose next phase**:
   - **Option A**: `/speckit.clarify demo website` - Add refinements or explore edge cases
   - **Option B**: `/speckit.plan demo website` - Generate implementation plan (recommended)
3. After planning: `/speckit.tasks demo website` - Generate actionable task list
4. After tasks: `/speckit.implement` - Execute implementation

**Recommended**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan demo website` since specification has zero ambiguities.
