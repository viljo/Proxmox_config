## Specification Lifecycle

```
ðŸ“‹ Planned â†’ ðŸš§ Active â†’ âœ… Completed
     â†“           â†“            â†“
  (ideas)   (in progress)  (deployed)
```

### Stage Definitions

1. **ðŸ“‹ Planned** (`planned/`)
   - Feature has been specced but not started
   - May have design documents
   - Waiting for capacity or dependencies

2. **ðŸš§ Active** (`active/`)
   - Currently being implemented
   - Has assigned developer/team
   - Regular progress updates

3. **âœ… Completed** (`completed/`)
   - Fully implemented and deployed
   - Passed testing and verification
   - Documentation complete
   - Archived for reference

## Specification Structure

Each spec directory should contain:

- **Required**:
  - `spec.md` - Main specification document

- **Optional** (depending on complexity):
  - `plan.md` - Implementation plan
  - `research.md` - Technical research and analysis
  - `data-model.md` - Data structures and entities
  - `quickstart.md` - Quick start guide
  - `tasks.md` - Implementation task breakdown
  - `checklists/` - Validation checklists
  - `contracts/` - API contracts and schemas

## Creating a New Spec

1. Create spec directory in `planned/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir specs/planned/009-feature-name
   ```

2. Create spec file:
   ```bash
   cp .specify/templates/spec-template.md specs/planned/009-feature-name/spec.md
   ```

3. Fill out the specification following the template

4. Update this README to include the new spec in the Planned table

## Moving Between Stages

### Planned â†’ Active

When starting work on a planned spec:

```bash
git mv specs/planned/XXX-feature specs/active/XXX-feature
# Update this README to move from Planned to Active table
```

### Active â†’ Completed

When deployment is complete:

```bash
git mv specs/active/XXX-feature specs/completed/XXX-feature
# Update this README to move from Active to Completed table
```

## Priority Levels

- **High**: Critical infrastructure, security, or blocking other work
- **Medium**: Important but not urgent, quality of life improvements
- **Low**: Nice to have, future enhancements

## Complexity Levels

- **Low**: 1-3 days of work, minimal dependencies
- **Medium**: 1-2 weeks of work, some integration required
- **High**: 2+ weeks, significant architecture changes

## Implementation Guidelines

Before moving a spec to Active:

1. âœ… Spec document is complete and reviewed
2. âœ… Dependencies are identified and available
3. âœ… Resource allocation confirmed
4. âœ… Architecture decisions documented (ADRs if needed)
5. âœ… Testing approach defined

Before moving to Completed:

1. âœ… All code implemented and merged
2. âœ… Deployed to production
3. âœ… Tests passing
4. âœ… Documentation updated
5. âœ… Verified working as specified
6. âœ… Runbooks created if needed

## Archived Specs

Specs that are deprecated, canceled, or superseded by other implementations:

_None yet_

## Constitution Compliance

Feature specifications are required by the project constitution:
> "All new features must have a specification document before implementation"

This ensures:
- Clear requirements before coding
- Architectural decisions are documented
- Testing criteria are defined
- Knowledge is preserved
