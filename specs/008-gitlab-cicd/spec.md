# Feature Specification: GitLab CI/CD Platform

**Feature Branch**: `008-gitlab-cicd`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "gitlab and gitlab runners"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Version Control and Code Repository Hosting (Priority: P1)

Developers need a self-hosted Git platform to store, version, and manage source code repositories for all infrastructure and application projects, providing a central location for code collaboration with access control, branching, and history tracking.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability - without version control hosting, CI/CD and collaboration features cannot function. Every development workflow starts with code storage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new project, cloning the repository, making commits, pushing changes, and verifying all commits appear in the GitLab web UI with full history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has GitLab account, **When** they create a new project and push code, **Then** repository is accessible via HTTPS/SSH with full commit history visible
2. **Given** repository exists with code, **When** developer clones and makes changes locally, **Then** they can push commits and see them reflected in GitLab UI within seconds
3. **Given** multiple developers working on same repository, **When** they push to different branches, **Then** all branches are preserved independently without conflicts
4. **Given** project has access controls configured, **When** unauthorized user attempts access, **Then** access is denied and attempt is logged

---

### User Story 2 - CI/CD Pipeline Automation (Priority: P2)

Developers need automated CI/CD pipelines that trigger on code commits, running tests, builds, and deployments without manual intervention, ensuring code quality and enabling rapid, reliable deployments to infrastructure.

**Why this priority**: Automates manual testing and deployment workflows, significantly improving development velocity. Depends on P1 (repositories) but can be added incrementally after basic version control is working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a .gitlab-ci.yml file in a repository, committing a change, and verifying the pipeline executes automatically with job status visible in GitLab UI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** repository has .gitlab-ci.yml pipeline definition, **When** developer pushes code, **Then** CI pipeline triggers automatically within 30 seconds
2. **Given** pipeline is running, **When** jobs execute, **Then** real-time logs are visible in GitLab UI showing progress and results
3. **Given** pipeline includes test stage, **When** tests fail, **Then** pipeline stops and developer is notified with failure details
4. **Given** pipeline succeeds, **When** deployment stage runs, **Then** artifacts are built and available for download or deployment
5. **Given** multiple commits pushed rapidly, **When** pipelines queue, **Then** each runs in order without conflicts or job interference

---

### User Story 3 - Code Review and Merge Request Workflow (Priority: P3)

Developers need a code review process where changes are proposed via merge requests, reviewed by team members with inline comments, approved, and merged into main branches, ensuring code quality and knowledge sharing.

**Why this priority**: Enhances code quality and team collaboration, but basic version control and CI/CD can function without it. Adds significant value for team workflows once core infrastructure is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a feature branch, pushing changes, opening a merge request, adding review comments, approving, and merging - all visible in GitLab UI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer creates feature branch with changes, **When** they open merge request, **Then** diff is visible with option to add reviewers and comments
2. **Given** merge request is open, **When** reviewer adds inline comments, **Then** developer receives notification and can respond or update code
3. **Given** merge request has required approvals, **When** developer clicks merge, **Then** changes merge to target branch and merge request closes
4. **Given** merge request triggers CI pipeline, **When** pipeline fails, **Then** merge is blocked until pipeline passes (configurable)

---

### User Story 4 - Container Registry for Docker Images (Priority: P4)

Operations team needs a private Docker container registry to store built images from CI/CD pipelines, enabling secure image distribution for deployments without relying on external registries.

**Why this priority**: Valuable for container-based deployments but not essential for basic CI/CD. Can be added after core pipeline functionality is proven. Requires additional storage and configuration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by building a Docker image in a CI pipeline, pushing it to the GitLab registry, and pulling the image from another host using authentication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** CI pipeline builds Docker image, **When** pipeline pushes to GitLab registry, **Then** image appears in project's container registry with tagged version
2. **Given** image exists in registry, **When** external host authenticates and pulls image, **Then** image downloads successfully with all layers
3. **Given** multiple images with different tags, **When** listing registry contents, **Then** all images and tags are visible with size and creation date
4. **Given** old images exist, **When** cleanup policy runs, **Then** images older than retention period are automatically deleted

### Edge Cases

- What happens when GitLab container runs out of disk space during repository clone or CI pipeline execution?
- How does system handle concurrent CI pipelines from multiple projects competing for runner resources?
- What occurs when GitLab runner loses connection to GitLab server mid-pipeline execution?
- How are failed pipeline artifacts handled - stored, cleaned up, or retained for debugging?
- What happens when repository size exceeds allocated storage limits?
- How does system handle SSH key authentication failures or expired tokens?
- What occurs when merge conflicts prevent automatic merge completion?
- How are large file uploads (>100MB) handled in git repositories?
- What happens when CI pipeline runs longer than maximum timeout?
- How does system handle GitLab version upgrades without service disruption?
