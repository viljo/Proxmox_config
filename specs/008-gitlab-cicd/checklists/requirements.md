# Specification Quality Checklist: GitLab CI/CD Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec focuses on capabilities (Git hosting, CI/CD pipelines, container registry) without mentioning specific technologies like Ruby, Rails, or PostgreSQL implementations

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - All user stories describe business value (version control, automation, code review, secure registry) from developer/operations perspective

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - Language is clear and business-focused. Technical terms like "merge request" and "pipeline" are explained in context

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - **Status**: PASS - Zero clarification markers found. Reasonable defaults used: GitLab CE, 2 shared runners, 100GB storage, Keycloak OIDC auth

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) specify concrete capabilities: "MUST provide Git repository hosting", "MUST execute CI/CD pipelines", "MUST support merge requests"

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All SC metrics include specific numbers: "within 2 minutes" (SC-001), "30 seconds" (SC-002), "10 concurrent pipelines" (SC-003), "10 MB/s" (SC-004)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - Criteria focus on user outcomes: "developers can create project", "pipelines trigger automatically", "web UI pages load in under 2 seconds"

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - Each user story (P1-P4) has 4-5 Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios covering primary flows and edge cases

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 10 edge cases documented covering disk space, concurrency, failures, authentication, upgrades

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - "Out of Scope" section lists 15 excluded features including GitLab EE, Geo, Pages, HA, K8s integration

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - Dependencies section lists 14 prerequisites (Proxmox, Debian, auth, reverse proxy, monitoring). Assumptions section lists 15 infrastructure assumptions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - Each FR maps to user story acceptance scenarios. FR-003 (CI/CD execution) → US2 acceptance scenarios, FR-007 (merge requests) → US3 scenarios

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - 4 prioritized user stories cover full Git workflow: P1 version control (foundation) → P2 CI/CD automation → P3 code review → P4 container registry

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - SC-001 through SC-010 provide end-to-end verification: project creation (SC-001), pipeline trigger (SC-002), concurrency (SC-003), performance (SC-004, SC-005, SC-008), reliability (SC-006), retention (SC-007), usability (SC-009, SC-010)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec describes WHAT (capabilities) not HOW (implementation). References to "PostgreSQL" and "Redis" in Dependencies section are deployment prerequisites, not implementation mandates

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All 4 user stories are independently testable as required
- Resource requirements clearly specified: GitLab server (4GB RAM, 4 CPU, 100GB), runners (2GB RAM, 2 CPU each)
- Security requirements comprehensively defined (SR-001 through SR-010)
- Success criteria provide clear pass/fail validation for deployment
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults avoiding unnecessary clarification questions
- GitLab Community Edition (CE) specified in assumptions - appropriate default for self-hosted deployment
