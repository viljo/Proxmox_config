# Specification Quality Checklist: External SSH Access via viljo.se

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains proper abstraction level:
- Focus on business outcome (external SSH access via domain name)
- No unnecessary implementation details (DNS provider, firewall brand agnostic)
- Language accessible to stakeholders (clear domain→IP mapping concept)
- All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Requirements are comprehensive and clear:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (reasonable defaults used)
- Each requirement is testable (e.g., "route SSH connections from viljo.se", "DNS resolution under 2 seconds")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds DNS, 10 seconds connection, 5 minutes DNS propagation)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (no specific firewall or DNS software mentioned)
- Acceptance scenarios cover external access, port forwarding persistence, and security
- Edge cases identified (DNS failures, dynamic IP changes, host offline)
- Scope explicitly bounded in "Out of Scope" section (VPN, web console, VM access excluded)
- Dependencies clearly documented (DNS service, router/firewall, Loopia DDNS)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning:
- All 8 functional requirements have acceptance criteria through user scenarios
- Three user stories cover primary flows (P1: external access, P2: port forwarding, P3: security)
- Seven measurable success criteria align with feature goals
- Infrastructure and security requirements appropriately scoped for external SSH access
- Leverages existing Loopia DDNS infrastructure role

## Notes

Specification successfully passes all quality checks. The feature is well-scoped with:
- Clear prioritization (P1: external SSH access, P2: persistent forwarding, P3: security hardening)
- Reasonable assumptions (domain registered, router supports forwarding, Loopia DDNS available)
- Explicit dependencies on DNS service, router/firewall, existing Loopia DDNS role
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user outcomes (connection time, reliability)

**Corrected Understanding**: Feature enables external SSH access to Proxmox host (mother @ 192.168.1.3) via viljo.se domain, NOT an SSH bastion gateway for infrastructure access.

**Status**: ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan`
