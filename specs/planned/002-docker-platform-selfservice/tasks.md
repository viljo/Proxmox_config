# Tasks: Self-Service Docker Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-docker-platform-selfservice/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, so no test tasks are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Ansible roles**: `roles/<service>/tasks/`, `roles/<service>/templates/`
- **Playbooks**: `playbooks/` for orchestration
- **Configuration**: `group_vars/`, `host_vars/`, `inventory/`
- **Documentation**: `docs/` for architecture and operations guides

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Environment Lifecycle Management (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Enable users to pause, resume, snapshot, and delete environments with proper cleanup and data retention policies.

**Independent Test**: User clicks "Pause Environment", all containers stop, HTTPS unavailable, status shows "Paused". User clicks "Resume", containers restart, HTTPS accessible within 2 minutes.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Foundational - Depends on User Story 1 (needs provisioned environments)
  - User Story 3 (P3): Can start after Foundational - Depends on User Story 2 (needs container deployment capability)
  - User Story 4 (P4): Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories (monitoring)
  - User Story 5 (P5): Can start after Foundational - Depends on User Story 1 (needs environments to pause/resume/delete)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Request Environment**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - **MVP candidate**
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Deploy Containers**: Depends on User Story 1 (needs provisioned environments to deploy to)
- **User Story 3 (P3) - CI/CD Integration**: Depends on User Story 2 (needs container deployment capability to automate)
- **User Story 4 (P4) - Monitoring**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (can monitor any environment)
- **User Story 5 (P5) - Lifecycle**: Depends on User Story 1 (needs environments to manage lifecycle)

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1 + Phase 2** (Setup + Foundational) - CRITICAL foundation
2. **Phase 3** (User Story 1) - MVP: Environment provisioning with auto-approval and HTTPS access
3. **Phase 4** (User Story 2) - Container deployment via Portainer GUI
4. **Phase 6** (User Story 4) - Monitoring (can be done in parallel with User Story 2/3)
5. **Phase 5** (User Story 3) - CI/CD automation
6. **Phase 7** (User Story 5) - Lifecycle management (pause, resume, snapshot, delete)
7. **Phase 8** (Polish) - Documentation, security, performance, validation

### Within Each User Story

- Templates before tasks (templates are referenced in tasks)
- Defaults before tasks (defaults define variables used in tasks)
- Tasks in dependency order (lxc_create before docker_install before portainer_agent)
- Handlers after tasks (handlers are triggered by tasks)
- Playbooks orchestrate roles (playbooks come after role implementation)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003, T004, T006, T007, T008, T009)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Within each subsystem, [P] tasks can run in parallel:
- NetBox: T011, T012 can run in parallel
- Traefik: T015-T019 can run in parallel (templates and tasks for different files)
- Portainer: T023-T026 can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**: T031-T034 (templates) can run in parallel, T050-T051 (notifications) can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**: T057-T059 (registry config) can run in parallel, T060 independent of T064

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**: T068 independent of T075, T078-T079 (docs) can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (User Story 4)**: T083-T084 (monitoring), T087, T089, T091 can all run in parallel (different files)

**Phase 7 (User Story 5)**: T098-T099 (pause/resume) can run in parallel, T104 (snapshot) independent

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: All documentation tasks (T118-T122) can run in parallel, all security tasks (T123-T127) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all template tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: T031 "Create roles/docker_platform/defaults/main.yml"
Task: T032 "Create roles/docker_platform/templates/lxc.conf.j2"
Task: T033 "Create roles/docker_platform/templates/docker-compose.yml.j2"
Task: T034 "Create roles/docker_platform/templates/traefik-route.yml.j2"

# After templates, launch notification tasks in parallel:
Task: T050 "Create roles/docker_platform/tasks/notifications.yml"
Task: T051 "Create roles/docker_platform/templates/notification_email.j2"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (~2-3 hours)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (~8-12 hours) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (~12-16 hours)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Create environment request
   - Verify LXC provisioned on Proxmox
   - Verify Docker installed in LXC
   - Verify Portainer Agent deployed
   - Verify Traefik route created
   - Verify HTTPS access with valid TLS cert
   - Verify NetBox registration
   - Verify email notification sent
5. Deploy/demo if ready - **This is a functional MVP!**

**MVP Scope**: Setup + Foundational + User Story 1 = ~22-31 hours total

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (~10-15 hours)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) (~12-16 hours, total ~22-31 hours)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (~6-8 hours, total ~28-39 hours)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (monitoring can be parallel) (~8-10 hours, total ~36-49 hours)
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (CI/CD automation) (~10-12 hours, total ~46-61 hours)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (lifecycle management) (~8-10 hours, total ~54-71 hours)
7. Add Polish ‚Üí Final validation (~6-8 hours, total ~60-79 hours)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (~10-15 hours)
2. **Once Foundational is done**, assign in dependency order:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (P1) - Required first, MVP
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (P4) - Can start after Foundational (monitoring is independent)
3. **After User Story 1 complete**:
   - **Developer C**: User Story 2 (P2) - Needs provisioned environments
   - **Developer D**: User Story 5 (P5) - Needs environments to manage
4. **After User Story 2 complete**:
   - **Developer E**: User Story 3 (P3) - Needs container deployment capability
5. **All complete** ‚Üí **Team does Polish together**

This approach allows 2-3 developers to work in parallel after Foundational phase while respecting dependencies.

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies within the same phase
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Performance targets**: LXC provision <5min (T128), container deploy <2min, TLS cert <5min, 95% webhook success (T053)
- **Security**: All secrets in Ansible Vault (T005, T127), unprivileged LXC (T032), nftables isolation (T123), AppArmor profiles (T124)
- **Idempotency**: All playbooks must support re-running safely with state checks before changes
- **CMDB**: All environments must be registered in NetBox (T039, T113) as Single Source of Truth
