# Specification Quality Checklist: Self-Service Docker Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need (self-service Docker environments, GUI management, CI/CD integration) and WHY (eliminate manual provisioning, empower developers)
- Written in plain language describing user workflows (request environment, deploy containers, integrate pipelines)
- Technology references (Proxmox, Debian, Portainer, Traefik, GitLab) appear only in "Platform Baseline" context and assumptions, not in requirements
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with 5 prioritized user stories

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements concrete
- Each requirement testable (e.g., FR-001: "web-based dashboard where users can request environments" - verifiable by attempting to create one)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: "under 5 minutes", SC-002: "under 2 minutes", SC-003: "95% success rate", SC-004: "99% uptime")
- Success criteria user-focused without implementation (not "Proxmox API latency" but "environment ready in under 5 minutes")
- All 5 user stories include detailed Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios (4 scenarios per story average)
- Edge cases comprehensive (8 scenarios covering resource exhaustion, TLS failures, duplicate names, paused deployments, concurrent access)
- Scope clearly bounded through P1-P5 prioritization (P1: environment creation → P5: lifecycle management)
- 12 explicit assumptions documented (Proxmox API availability, DNS configuration, LDAP directory, resource capacity)

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- 22 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-022) all map to user stories
- User scenarios cover complete lifecycle: request (P1), deploy (P2), automate (P3), monitor (P4), manage (P5)
- 10 success criteria measurable without knowing implementation details
- Infrastructure (IR-010) and Security (SR-010) requirements separated from user-facing functional requirements
- No technology-specific success criteria (e.g., not "Traefik config update <1s" but "HTTPS access within 5 minutes")

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to begin technical design.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear MVP path: P1 (environment provisioning) delivers immediate value, P2-P5 add capabilities incrementally
- Comprehensive security posture with 10 security requirements aligned with project constitution
- Edge case coverage anticipates operational challenges (resource limits, certificate failures, authentication outages)
- Success criteria provide concrete acceptance tests for each user story priority level
- Assumptions explicitly document dependencies on existing infrastructure (Proxmox, Traefik, GitLab, LDAP)

**No issues found** - specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for implementation planning.
